# ArduPlant
This is ArduPlant! ArduPlant is a gardening system that takes care of the watering for you. It uses a moisture sensor to detect how dry your plant's soil is, then it will evenly pump out water around the pot. Your only job is to ensure that your water tank stays filled, and that's it! You can connect the ArduPlant to your computer and access its processing infromation using the Arduino IDE and the integrated Serial Monitor. This will allow you to see your plant's soil moisture level in real time and it will give you updates on what the ArduPlant is doing: calibrating, reading sensors, watering. Every couple of days the microcomputer will blink rapidly as a reminder to check the water tank's level. No need to press any buttons, it's just a reminder! Enjoy the fun of gardening without the stress of making sure you water your  plant at the right time, don't overwater, or don't underwater. Just sit back and focus on the more important things!

Instructions for Setup:
- Place moisture sensor in soil.
- Plug in Arduino 5V adapter and watch for the three setup blinks to indicate the ArduPlant is ready, and also make sure the moisture sensor's light is on.
- Plug in pump 12V adapter.
